# Treasure_Hunt_A
A project created by @MariosAntakis and @DimitriosDiakoloukas , about a treasure hunt game in c.
This is the story and the rules of the game which you can also find in the code and when you play the game:

You find yourself somewhere in an island with treasures, forests, mountainscaves, cliffs, a beech tree and of course sea all around.
Your goal is to find the treasure as fast as possible without falling in the sea with the sharks.You have a map which you can see (X), or move north (B),
    east (A), south (N), west (D), doing one move at a time.
    However your compass  isn't too accurate. There is only
    80% chance to move towards the desired direction, while
    there is 20%% chance to move diagonally right or left towards
    the desired direction. Every time you make a move you will
    get information about the place you are on the map.
    If you fall in the sea , you will come back at the place you
    were before your unlucky move, except if you disturb the sharks.
    The possibility of being eaten by the sharks the first time 
    you fall in the sea is 20%%. The second time you fall
    the possibility of being eaten is 70%%. The third time
    you fall in the sea will be your last!
    Since you have the map of the island, you will be able to
    specify your position approximately.The reason you can't 
    be sure about your exact position is that you might have
    moved diagonally right or left in a move. With some practise,
    you will be able to find the treasure in less than 15 moves.
    The game becomes even more interesting at the second level in which 
    you have to find the treasure with a limited amount of energy
    Each move reduces your energy by one.
    You can increase your energy by one if you find food or water
    Lastly there is a possibility of falling in quicksand from which
    you won't be able to come out alive.
